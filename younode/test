 If you don't understand all of the different things in the diagram it is completely okay.
The point is to show that a single node process (the hexagon in the middle) can act as the
broker between all of the different I/O endpoints (orange and purple represent I/O).

Usually building these kinds of systems is either:

    1-difficult to code but yields super fast results (like writing your web servers from scratch in C)
    2-easy to code but not very speedy/robust (like when someone tries to upload a 5GB file and your
    server crashes)

Node's goal is to strike a balance between these two: relatively easy to understand and use and fast 
enough for most use cases.
